## Design Suggestion
If I may suggest, I suggest adding rs485 to make it more flexible, accurate, and durable. So that in the future you can add other sensors such as
- [Soil Moisture, Temperature, pH & EC Sensor] (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2830.html) 
- [Soil NPK Measure Sensor] (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2819.html)
or other sensors with interfaces using rs485
